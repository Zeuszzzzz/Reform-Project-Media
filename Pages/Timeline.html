                        <p>The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was a U.S. law that regulated the importation, cultivation, possession, and distribution of marijuana through taxation and strict documentation requirements. Though intended to curb recreational use, it effectively restricted industrial hemp and medical research. Violations carried fines and prison time, and the act marked a shift toward federal criminalization of marijuana.</p>

                        <p>In 1964, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, was isolated for the first time. This breakthrough addressed a major obstacle in medical use, as cannabis preparations had previously varied in potency due to inconsistent plant composition. Identifying THC allowed for more standardized research and dosing, laying the groundwork for modern medical cannabis studies.</p>

                        <p>The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 established a federal framework to regulate drugs based on their medical use, potential for abuse, and safety. Cannabis was classified as a Schedule I substance, indicating high abuse potential and no accepted medical use federally, making its manufacture, distribution, and use illegal under federal law despite some state-level legalizations. This classification has significantly influenced the legal status and research of marijuana in the U.S.</p>
