        <h1>Cartoon</h1>
        <div class="container textPages">
            <img width="30%" src="../../Reform-Project-Media/Images/Political Cartoon.jpg" alt="there is 2 sections where the top is in black and white to show that it is in the past with a ceo from the tobacco industry telling congress that &quot;senator our cigarettes are not harmful!\&quot; then the bottom section is in color is a ceo from a the mariguana industry saying &quot;\Senator our super potent pot is not harmful!&quot;" />
            <p>
                The cartoon makes a powerful argument by drawing a historical
                parallel between the tobacco industry’s past denial of harm and
                the modern cannabis industry's messaging. By using a
                black-and-white section to depict a tobacco CEO falsely claiming
                cigarettes are not harmful, the cartoon invokes a
                well-documented moment of corporate deception that led to
                serious public health consequences. The color section, showing a
                marijuana CEO making a nearly identical claim about high-potency
                cannabis, serves as a stark warning: we may be repeating
                history.
            </p>
            <p>
                This visual juxtaposition is insightful in that it critiques not
                just the cannabis industry, but also society’s tendency to
                downplay emerging health risks when profit and political
                momentum are involved. The cartoon highlights the potential
                danger of under-regulating an increasingly commercialized and
                potent product without fully understanding its long-term
                effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally executed and visually strategic, the cartoon uses
                familiar symbolism—Congress, CEOs, and the transition from
                black-and-white to color—to communicate its message with
                clarity. It implies that just as the tobacco industry's
                assurances were eventually exposed as misleading, similar claims
                from today’s marijuana industry should be met with critical
                scrutiny. The cartoon ultimately calls for caution,
                transparency, and scientific rigor in how cannabis is promoted
                and regulated.
