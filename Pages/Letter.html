                <p>
                    Dear Editor, As our country embraces the legalization of
                    cannabis, we must remain vigilant against repeating the same
                    public health mistakes we made with tobacco. Decades ago,
                    tobacco industry leaders stood before Congress and falsely
                    claimed their products were harmless. Today, the marijuana
                    industry is doing the same—downplaying the risks of
                    increasingly potent cannabis products while aggressively
                    marketing to consumers. Research has shown clear links
                    between high-potency cannabis and serious health outcomes. A
                    study by <em>Jouanjus et al. (2011)</em> documented numerous
                    emergency room visits tied to cannabis use, ranging from
                    cardiovascular issues to acute psychiatric symptoms. Unlike
                    the low-THC marijuana of the past, today’s products often
                    exceed 20–30% THC, making them far more powerful and
                    potentially harmful. The public deserves transparency and
                    regulation. We failed to act quickly enough with cigarettes,
                    and millions paid the price. Let’s not wait for another
                    public health crisis to unfold. We must demand strict
                    oversight of cannabis potency, clearer labeling, and honest
                    dialogue about its risks.
                </p>

            <h2>Response to the Letter</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Dear Editor, The concerns raised about high-potency cannabis
                    are valid, particularly when viewed through the lens of
                    public health history. Comparing the marijuana industry to
                    Big Tobacco is a powerful reminder of what can happen when
                    profit outweighs responsibility. However, the solution isn’t
                    to instill fear—it’s to ensure that policy is guided by
                    current science and public education. While the
                    <em>Jouanjus et al. (2011)</em> study does highlight medical
                    incidents related to cannabis, the broader context shows
                    that such cases are relatively rare compared to other
                    substances like alcohol or prescription opioids. Instead of
                    prohibition-style thinking, we need modern regulatory
                    strategies THC potency caps, clearer dosage standards, and
                    consumer education campaigns that reflect both the risks and
                    benefits. Marijuana legalization is an opportunity to do
                    better than we did with tobacco. Let’s use this moment not
                    to panic, but to build smart, proactive policies that
                    prioritize health, safety, and informed choice.
