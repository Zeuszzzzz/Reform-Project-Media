                    The story of a woman in her 30s, as reported by Fraser
                    (2019), illustrates the often-hidden risks of cannabis
                    addiction despite legalization efforts. According to Fraser,
                    this woman works for the government, is a mother, and is
                    active in her community, yet she struggled with cannabis
                    abuse that began in her teenage years. She described having
                    a "highly addictive personality" and experiencing trauma
                    from sexual assault, which led her to self-medicate with
                    cannabis, hashish, and alcohol. Although she initially
                    planned to attend university, her addiction led her to spend
                    much of her early 20s partying, demonstrating how cannabis
                    can derail personal and professional goals.

                    Fraser (2019) further details how the woman’s relapse
                    occurred after a decade of abstinence when she tried
                    cannabis socially, believing she was in control. Despite
                    cannabis not being legal at the time, she accessed it easily
                    through friends and growers. A prescription from her doctor
                    for cannabis to manage back pain unintentionally reinforced
                    her addiction, underscoring potential medical system
                    oversights regarding patients with prior addiction
                    histories. Her story challenges the notion that legalization
                    or medical use inherently equates to safe or controlled
                    consumption.

                    The article highlights how legalization gave the woman a
                    socially acceptable justification to continue using
                    cannabis, even as it negatively affected her work, finances,
                    and family life. Fraser (2019) recounts a harrowing incident
                    where she experienced a panic attack in public after
                    accidentally ingesting too much cannabis oil, which became a
                    turning point toward seeking help. Her guilt and the strain
                    on her relationships reflect broader societal risks of
                    normalizing cannabis use, especially when users downplay
                    addiction by comparing it to other substances.

                    Fraser (2019) also includes expert commentary from Dr.
                    Amanda Hudson, who confirms a 50% rise in cannabis-related
                    addiction cases in Prince Edward Island since legalization.
                    Dr. Hudson explains that cannabis use disorder, including
                    withdrawal symptoms and cannabis-induced psychosis, is
                    increasingly common, particularly among young adults and
                    heavy users. This clinical perspective, paired with the
                    woman’s personal experience, underscores the complex health
                    challenges legalization may exacerbate.

                    By examining this woman’s struggle as detailed in Fraser
                    (2019), it becomes clear that cannabis addiction can quietly
                    devastate lives and families. Her story demonstrates the
                    importance of cautious cannabis policies that recognize
                    potential harms and prioritize prevention, treatment, and
                    public education over unfettered legalization.
